# Repository for class cs361 (Algorithms) at Western Oregon University

This repositry holds some of the assignments from my cs361 class. Note that only the most important or completed assignments were added. Here is a brief summary of every assignment in the folder.

## cs361_hw1

This assignment was done in the language c++ on QT Creator. This project compares the speed of Quick sort and Merge sort algorithms. It loads in a file with a long list of integers, applies each algorithm to a copy of it, and them compares the time it takes for each to run. There is also a check to see if both copies of the list actually get sorted in the end.

## cs361_h3

This assignment was done in the language c++ on QT Creator. The first part of the project involves running both a bottom up and memoization version of Matrix Chain Multiplication on the same set of data from a vector. Then it outputs the results of each. The second part shows a breath first search through both an Adjacency List and Adjacency Matrix. Then it outputs the order of each one.

## cs361_hw4

This assignment was done in the language c++ on QT Creator. The first part is just an implementation of a DFA and its application on a few string examples. The second part is an implementation of a Bellman-Ford algorithm on a graph.
